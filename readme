This projects works
    -it works when deployed on AWS
    -it works locally by connecting to AWS (secret manager, PostgreSQL DB, SES email)

To run it, you will need to do the below:
1-create RDS, postgreSQL DB
    -free tier
    -make public IP
    -add Security Group
        -add your IP as Inbound
-get the connection details. You will save them in Security Manager later

-postgress table creation:

CREATE TABLE Work (
    idwork SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    description VARCHAR(400),
    guide VARCHAR(45),
	status VARCHAR(400),
	username VARCHAR(45),
	archive SMALLINT
);

    -username: from the above DB connection
    -password: from the above DB connection
    -host: from the above DB connection
 -add name to the DB: dev/postgres/connection (you will use this in Java code)


3-add your email using Simple Email Service SES, Identity

4-deploy it on Beanstalk
-create new Beanstalk application
-choose upload from file
-select the jar file from target folder of this project
-use the same security group of the DB (if possible)
-make the IP access public
-add the credentials to the environment (check the aws/cred.txt file)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:
SERVER_PORT=5000

5-test now using soapui project and it should work
    -get to get list if items
    -post to add new item
